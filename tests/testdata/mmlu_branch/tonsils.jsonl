Waldeyer's ring surrounds the [naso-](nasopharynx \"wikilink\") and [oropharynx](oropharynx \"wikilink\"), with some of its tonsillar tissue located above and some below the [soft palate](soft_palate \"wikilink\") (and to the back of the [mouth cavity](oral_cavity \"wikilink\")). ## Structure The ring consists of the (from top to bottom): - 1 [pharyngeal tonsil](pharyngeal_tonsil \"wikilink\") (or \"adenoid\"), located on the roof of the nasopharynx, under the sphenoid bone. - 2 [tubal tonsils](tubal_tonsil \"wikilink\") on each side, where each [auditory tube](auditory_tube \"wikilink\") opens into the nasopharynx - 2 [palatine tonsils](palatine_tonsil \"wikilink\") (commonly called \"the tonsils\") located in the oropharynx - [lingual tonsils](lingual_tonsil \"wikilink\"), a collection of lymphatic tissue located on the back part of the [tongue](tongue \"wikilink\") ### Terminology Some authors speak of two pharyngeal tonsils\/two adenoids. These authors simply look at the left and right halves of the pharyngeal tonsil as two tonsils. Many authors also speak of lingual tonsils (in the plural), because this accumulation of lymphoid tissue consists of a number of little prominences \u2013 many smaller rounded masses. Whether to collectively call all these a single tonsil or separate tonsils is to an extent an arbitrary decision. ### Variation There also normally is a good amount of [mucosa](mucosa \"wikilink\")-associated [lymphoid tissue](lymphoid_tissue \"wikilink\") ([MALT](Mucosa-associated_lymphoid_tissue \"wikilink\")) present between all these tonsils (intertonsillar) around the ring, and more of this lymphoid tissue can variably be found more or less throughout at least the naso- and oropharynx. ### Development The tubal tonsils usually develop from an accumulation of lymphoid tissue in the pharyngeal tonsil. ## Clinical significance The [palatine tonsils](palatine_tonsil \"wikilink\") when inflamed\/swollen, more common in children, can obstruct respiration.[1] Inflammation of the tonsils is called [tonsillitis](tonsillitis \"wikilink\") and removal is called [tonsillectomy](tonsillectomy \"wikilink\").[2] ## Etymology of Waldeyer's ring Waldeyer's ring was named after the nineteenth-century [German](Germans \"wikilink\") [anatomist](Anatomy \"wikilink\") [Heinrich Wilhelm Gottfried von Waldeyer-Hartz](Heinrich_Wilhelm_Gottfried_von_Waldeyer-Hartz \"wikilink\").[3] ## Other animals Some animals, but not humans, have one or two additional tonsils: - Soft palate tonsil - Paraepiglottic tonsil In [anatomy](anatomy \"wikilink\"), the **pharyngeal tonsil**, also known as the **nasopharyngeal tonsil** or **adenoid**, is the [superior](anatomical_terms_of_location#Superior_and_inferior \"wikilink\")-most of the [tonsils](tonsil \"wikilink\"). It is a mass of [lymphatic tissue](Lymphatic_tissues \"wikilink\") located behind the [nasal cavity](nasal_cavity \"wikilink\"), in the roof of the [nasopharynx](nasopharynx \"wikilink\"), where the [nose](human_nose \"wikilink\") blends into the [throat](throat \"wikilink\"). In [children](child \"wikilink\"), it normally forms a soft mound in the roof and back wall of the nasopharynx, just above and behind the [uvula](palatine_uvula \"wikilink\"). The term *adenoid* is also used to represent [adenoid hypertrophy](adenoid_hypertrophy \"wikilink\"), the abnormal growth of the pharyngeal tonsils.[4] ## Structure The adenoid is a mass of [lymphatic tissue](Lymphatic_tissues \"wikilink\") located behind the nasal cavity, in the roof of the [nasopharynx](nasopharynx \"wikilink\"), where the nose blends into the throat. The adenoid, unlike the [palatine tonsils](palatine_tonsil \"wikilink\"), has [pseudostratified epithelium](pseudostratified_epithelium \"wikilink\").[5] The adenoids are part of the so-called [Waldeyer ring](Waldeyer's_tonsillar_ring \"wikilink\") of lymphoid tissue which also includes the palatine tonsils, the [lingual tonsils](lingual_tonsils \"wikilink\") and the [tubal tonsils](tubal_tonsils \"wikilink\"). ### Development Adenoids develop from a subepithelial infiltration of [lymphocytes](lymphocytes \"wikilink\") after the 16th week of embryonic life.

Even if the enlarged adenoid is not substantial enough to physically block the back of the nose, it can obstruct airflow enough so that breathing through the nose requires an uncomfortable amount of work, and inhalation occurs instead through an open mouth. The enlarged adenoid would also obstruct the nasal airway enough to affect the voice without actually stopping nasal airflow altogether. Symptomatic enlargement between 18 and 24 months of age is not uncommon, meaning that snoring, nasal airway obstruction and obstructed breathing may occur during sleep. However, this may be reasonably expected to decline when children reach school age, and progressive shrinkage may be expected thereafter. ### Adenoid facies Enlargement of the adenoid, especially in children, causes an atypical appearance of the face, often referred to as *adenoid facies*.[7] Features of adenoid facies include [mouth breathing](mouth_breathing \"wikilink\"), an elongated face, prominent incisors, [hypoplastic](hypoplastic \"wikilink\") [maxilla](maxilla \"wikilink\"), short upper lip, elevated nostrils, and a high arched palate.[8] ### Removal Surgical removal of the adenoid is a procedure called [adenoidectomy](adenoidectomy \"wikilink\"). Adenoid infection may cause symptoms such as excessive [mucus](mucus \"wikilink\") production, which can be treated by its removal. Studies have shown that adenoid regrowth occurs in as many as 19% of the cases after removal.[9] Carried out through the mouth under a [general anaesthetic](general_anaesthetic \"wikilink\") (or less commonly a [topical](topical_anesthetic \"wikilink\")), adenoidectomy involves the adenoid being [curetted](curette \"wikilink\"), [cauterized](cauterization \"wikilink\"), [lasered](Laser_surgery \"wikilink\"), or otherwise [ablated](Ablation#Medicine \"wikilink\").

Most [Immunoglobulin A](IgA \"wikilink\") produced by tonsillar B cells in vitro appears to be 7S monomers, although a significant proportion may be l0S dimeric IgA. In addition to humoral immunity elicited by tonsillar and [adenoidal](adenoid \"wikilink\") B cells following antigenic stimulation, there is considerable T-cell response in palatine tonsils.[31] Thus, natural infection or intranasal immunization with live, [attenuated](attenuator_(genetics) \"wikilink\") [rubella](rubella \"wikilink\") virus vaccine has been reported to prime tonsillar [lymphocytes](lymphocytes \"wikilink\") much better than [subcutaneous](Subcutaneous_injection \"wikilink\") vaccination. Also, natural infection with [varicella zoster virus](varicella_zoster_virus \"wikilink\") has been found to stimulate tonsillar lymphocytes better than lymphocytes from [peripheral blood](Peripheral_blood_cell \"wikilink\"). ### Cytokine action [Cytokines](Cytokines \"wikilink\") are humoral [immunomodulatory](immunomodulator \"wikilink\") proteins or [glycoproteins](glycoproteins \"wikilink\") which control or modulate the activities of target cells, resulting in gene activation, leading to mitotic division, growth and differentiation, migration, or [apoptosis](apoptosis \"wikilink\"). They are produced by wide range of cell types upon antigen-specific and non-antigen specific stimuli. It has been reported by many studies that the clinic outcome of many infectious, [autoimmune](autoimmune \"wikilink\"), or malignant diseases appears to be influenced by the overall balance of production (profiles) of pro-inflammatory and anti-inflammatory cytokines. Therefore, determination of cytokine profiles in tonsil study will provide key information for further in-depth analysis of the cause and underlying mechanisms of these disorders, as well as the role and possible interactions between the T- and B-lymphocytes and other immunocompetent cells.[32] The cytokine network represents a very sophisticated and versatile regulatory system that is essential to the immune system for overcoming the various defense strategies of microorganisms. Through several studies, the [Th1](T_helper_cell \"wikilink\") and [Th2](Th2 \"wikilink\") cytokines and cytokine mRNA are both detectable in tonsillar hypertrophy (or [obstructive sleep apnea](obstructive_sleep_apnea \"wikilink\"), OSA) and recurrent [tonsillitis](tonsillitis \"wikilink\") groups. It showed that human palatine tonsil is an active immunological organ containing a wide range of cytokine-producing cells. Both Th1 and Th2 cells are involved in the [pathophysiology](pathophysiology \"wikilink\") of TH and RT conditions. Indeed, human tonsils persistently harbor [microbial](microbial \"wikilink\") antigens even when the subject is asymptomatic of ongoing infection. It could also be an effect of ontogeny of the immune system. ## Clinical significance The pathogenesis of infectious\/inflammatory disease in the tonsils most likely has its basis in their anatomic location and their inherent function as organ of immunity, processing infectious material, and other antigens and then becoming, paradoxically, a focus of infection\/inflammation. No single theory of pathogenesis has yet been accepted, however. Viral infection with secondary bacterial invasion may be one mechanism of the initiation of chronic disease,[33] but the effects of the environment, host factors, the widespread use of antibiotics, ecological considerations, and diet all may play a role.[34] A recent cross-sectional study revealed a high rate of prevalent virus infections in non-acutely ill patients undergoing routine tonsillectomy. However, none of the 27 detected viruses showed positive association to the tonsillar disease.[35] In children, the tonsils are common sites of infections that may give rise to acute or chronic tonsillitis. However, it is still an open question whether tonsillar hypertrophy is also caused by a persistent infection. Tonsillectomy is one of the most common major operations performed on children.

Beneath the epithelium is a layer of lymphoid nodules containing lymphocytes. [Mucous glands](Mucous_gland \"wikilink\") located at the root of tongue are drained through several ducts into the crypt of lingual tonsils.[49][50] Secretions of these mucous glands keep the crypt clean and free of any debris. ### Blood supply Lingual tonsils are located on posterior aspect of tongue which is supplied through:[51] - Lingual artery, branch of external carotid artery - Tonsillar branch of facial artery - Ascending and descending palatine arteries - Ascending pharyngeal branch of external carotid artery ### Nerve supply Lingual tonsils are innervated by tonsillar nerves from the tonsilar plexus, formed by the glossopharyngeal and vagus nerves.[52] ## Function <img src=\"Blausen_0861_Tonsils&amp;Throat_Anatomy2.png\" title=\"Tonsils and the throat\u2013lingual tonsils labelled\" width=\"240\" alt=\"Tonsils and the throat\u2013lingual tonsils labelled\" \/> Like other lymphatic tissues, the function of lingual tonsils is to prevent infections. These tonsils contain B and T lymphocytes which get activated when harmful bacteria and viruses come in contact with tonsils. B lymphocytes kill pathogens by producing antibodies against them, while T lymphocytes directly kill them releasing cytotoxic substances or indirectly by stimulating other cells of the immune system.[53][54][55] ## Clinical significance ### Cancer [Squamous cell](Squamous_cell \"wikilink\") carcinoma is a type of neoplasm that can affect lingual tonsils.[56] ### Sleep apnea Enlarged or hypertrophic lingual tonsils have the potential to cause or exacerbate sleep apnea.[57] ## Additional images <File:Slide1sss.JPG%7CLingual> tonsil <File:Slide7ttt.JPG%7CLingual> tonsil <File:Slide12uuu.JPG>| Lingual tonsils ## External links - [Pictures at usc.edu](https:\/\/web.archive.org\/web\/20061206205431\/http:\/\/www.usc.edu\/hsc\/dental\/opfs\/QL\/23tn.html) - - - (labeled as 'lymphoid tissue')\\] - [Lingual Tonsil](http:\/\/www.anatomic.us\/atlas\/lingual-tonsil\/#sthash.NqffaOYP.dpuf) [1] [2] [3] [4] [5] [6] [7] [8] [9] [10] [11] [12] [13] [14] [15] [16] [17] Michael Tam,\"The Pharynx\"[1](http:\/\/download.videohelp.com\/vitualis\/med\/pharynx.htm), Medical Student's Retreat-Anatomy Notes, Last updated 30 March 2006.

Acute tonsillitis is the most common manifestation of tonsillar disease. It is associated with sore throat, fever and [difficulty swallowing](dysphagia \"wikilink\").[38] The tonsils may appear normal sized or enlarged but are usually erythematous. Often, but not always, [exudates](exudate \"wikilink\") can be seen. Not all these signs and symptoms are present in every patient. ### Recurrent tonsillitis Recurrent infection has been variably defined as from four to seven episodes of acute tonsillitis in one year, five episodes for two consecutive years or three episodes per year for 3 consecutive years.[39][40] ### Tonsillar hypertrophy Tonsillar hypertrophy is the enlargement of the tonsils, but without the history of inflammation. Obstructive tonsillar hypertrophy is currently the most common reason for tonsillectomy.[41] These patients present with varying degrees of disturbed sleep which may include symptoms of loud snoring, irregular breathing, nocturnal choking and coughing, frequent awakenings, [sleep apnea](sleep_apnea \"wikilink\"), [dysphagia](dysphagia \"wikilink\") and\/or daytime hypersomnolence. These may lead to behavioral\/mood changes in patients and facilitate the need for a [polysomnography](polysomnography \"wikilink\") in order to determine the degree to which these symptoms are disrupting their sleep.[42][43] ## Additional images <File:Illu> lymphatic system.jpg|Lymphatic system <File:Gray1201.png%7CThe> mouth cavity.

However, they are largest relative to the diameter of the throat in young children. In adults, each palatine tonsil normally measures up to 2.5 cm in length, 2.0 cm in width and 1.2 cm in thickness.[2] The adenoid grows until the age of 5, starts to shrink at the age of 7 and becomes small in adulthood. ## Function The tonsils are immunocompetent organs that serve as the immune system's first line of defense against ingested or inhaled foreign pathogens, and as such frequently engorge with blood to assist in immune responses to common illnesses such as the common cold. The tonsils have on their surface specialized antigen capture cells called [microfold cells](microfold_cell \"wikilink\") (M cells) that allow for the uptake of antigens produced by pathogens. These M cells then alert the B cells and T cells in the tonsil that a pathogen is present and an immune response is stimulated.[3] B cells are activated and proliferate in areas called germinal centers in the tonsil. These germinal centers are places where B memory cells are created and [secretory antibody (IgA)](Immunoglobulin_A \"wikilink\") is produced. ## Clinical significance ![Gross pathology of fresh hypertrophic tonsil. Top left: Surface facing the into the aerodigestive tract. Top right: Opposite surface (cauterized). Bottom: Cut sections.](Gross_pathology_of_tonsil.jpg \"Gross pathology of fresh hypertrophic tonsil. Top left: Surface facing the into the aerodigestive tract. Top right: Opposite surface (cauterized). Bottom: Cut sections.\") The palatine tonsils can become enlarged (adenotonsillar [hyperplasia](hyperplasia \"wikilink\")) or inflamed ([tonsillitis](tonsillitis \"wikilink\")). The most common way to treat tonsillitis is with [anti-inflammatory drugs](anti-inflammatory_drugs \"wikilink\") such as [ibuprofen](ibuprofen \"wikilink\"), or if bacterial in origin, [antibiotics](antibiotics \"wikilink\"), e.g. [amoxicillin](amoxicillin \"wikilink\") and [azithromycin](azithromycin \"wikilink\"). Surgical removal ([tonsillectomy](tonsillectomy \"wikilink\")) may be advised if the tonsils [obstruct the airway](upper_airway_obstruction \"wikilink\") or interfere with swallowing, or in patients with severe or recurrent [tonsillitis](tonsillitis \"wikilink\").[4] However, different mechanisms of pathogenesis for these two subtypes of tonsillar hypertrophy have been described,[5] and may have different responses to identical therapeutic efforts. In older patients, asymmetric tonsils (also known as asymmetric tonsil hypertrophy) may be an indicator of [virally infected](Viral_infection \"wikilink\") tonsils, or tumors such as [lymphoma](lymphoma \"wikilink\") or [squamous cell carcinoma](squamous_cell_carcinoma \"wikilink\"). A [tonsillolith](tonsillolith \"wikilink\") (also known as a \"tonsil stone\") is material that accumulates on the palatine tonsil. This can reach the size of a [peppercorn](peppercorn \"wikilink\") and is white or cream in color. The main substance is mostly [calcium](calcium \"wikilink\"), but it has a strong unpleasant odor because of [hydrogen sulfide](hydrogen_sulfide \"wikilink\") and [methyl mercaptan](methyl_mercaptan \"wikilink\") and other chemicals.[6] Palatine tonsil enlargement can affect speech, making it [hypernasal](Nasal_voice \"wikilink\") and giving it the sound of [velopharyngeal incompetence](velopharyngeal_incompetence \"wikilink\") (when space in the mouth is not fully separated from the nose's air space).[7] Tonsil size may have a more significant impact on upper airway obstruction for obese children than for those of average weight.[8] As mucosal lymphatic tissue of the aerodigestive tract, the palatine tonsils are viewed in some classifications as belonging to both the [gut-associated lymphoid tissue](gut-associated_lymphoid_tissue \"wikilink\") (GALT) and the [mucosa-associated lymphoid tissue](mucosa-associated_lymphoid_tissue \"wikilink\") (MALT). Other viewpoints treat them (and the [spleen](spleen \"wikilink\") and thymus) as large lymphatic organs contradistinguished from the smaller tissue loci of GALT and MALT. ## Additional images [`File:Blausen`](File:Blausen)` 0859 Tonsils&Adenoids.png|Illustration of frontal view of tonsils` [1] [2] [3] [4] Tonsilitis {{!}} Lymph Nodes | work = MedlinePlus | publisher = U.S. National Library of Medicine |access-date=2017-01-29|language=en}} [5] [6] [7] [8]","subject":"anatomy_tonsil","origin_branch_name":"release-20240425","pull_request":"742","dataset_type":"mcq_qa","answer":0,"choices":["Pharyngeal tonsil, tubal tonsils, palatine tonsils, and lingual tonsils","Adenoid tonsil, tubal tonsils, palatine tonsils, and lingual tonsils","Pharyngeal tonsil, tubal tonsils, palatine tonsils, and adenoid tonsils","Adenoid tonsil, tubal tonsils, palatine tonsils, and nasopharyngeal tonsils"],"question":"What are the four types of tonsils found in humans?"}
